# Horizon VM

## Overview
This file contains notes on the Horizon VM of the architecture. Among others, the purpose of this document is to take track of the OpenStack components, and each modules of these components specifically, that are installed on the Horizon VM.

**During development, all passwords are _localadmin_.**

## Basic configuration

Basic configuration is described in the [Controller.md](https://github.com/sylmarien/openstack-install-notes/blob/master/Controller.md) file. It is the shared configuration between all the VMs of the controller node.

**Network Configuration**

Modify `/etc/network/interfaces` to match the following content:

        # The loopback network interface
        auto lo
        iface lo inet loopback
        
        # The primary network interface
        auto eth0
        iface eth0 inet static
            address 10.89.201.2
            netmask 255.255.0.0
            broadcast 10.89.255.255
            gateway 10.89.0.1
            dns-nameservers 10.28.0.4 10.28.0.5
            dns-search uni.lux
        
        auto eth1
        iface eth1 inet static
            address 10.89.211.2
            netmask 255.255.0.0
            broadcast 10.89.255.255

Force eth0 to be loaded before eth1 on boot (if not, the routes are not properly configured and networking is broken).  
Modify `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules` to a content similar to the following:

    ```
    # This file was automatically generated by the /lib/udev/write_net_rules
    # program, run by the persistent-net-generator.rules rules file.
    #
    # You can modify it, as long as you keep each rule on a single
    # line, and change only the value of the NAME= key.
    
    # PCI device 0x1af4:0x1000 (virtio_net)
    SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="MAC_ADDRESS_ETH0", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"
    SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="MAC_ADDRESS_ETH1", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth1"
    ```
    Where `MAC_ADDRESS_ETH0` and `MAC_ADDRESS_ETH1` are the MAC addresses of the physical addresses eth0 and eth1.

**Basic prerequisites**

1. Install _python-software-properties_ package to ease repository management:  
  `apt-get install python-software-properties`
2. Enable the OpenStack repository (not necessary on Ubuntu 14.04 since Icehouse is the default version):  
  `add-apt-repository cloud-archive:icehouse`


## OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) installation

Follow the steps described in [Horizon.md](https://github.com/sylmarien/openstack-install-notes/blob/master/Horizon.md)
